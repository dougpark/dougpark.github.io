## Ideas on how to setup
* settings --> pasteimage
    * for setting path and filename options
    * pastes image into current_document_folder/images
    * prepends documentname_ to image name
    * pastes formatted md url at cursor in current
* change the keyboard shortcut 
    * I use ctrl-v to paste image from clipboard
